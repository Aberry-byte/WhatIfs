# What is 'WhatIfs'?
'WhatIfs' is a collection of thought provoking questions that
Diego and I would like to solve for ourselves. The questions as of
now come from "What If?" by Randall Munroe but we want our own answers to
these questions

# Setting up Conda environment
This project uses Jupyter notebooks and Conda to facilitate easy data analysis.

You can use the `WhatIf.yml` to set up your own conda environment with the following command

`conda env create -f WhatIf.yml`

This will create a new environment with every possible dependency needed for this type of data science and problem solving (feel free to open an issue if you feel like something is missing)

#### please be patient solving this environment is slow

## Now you can use your preferred Jupyter notebook editor
I recommend visual studio code with the Jupyter notebook and python extension
